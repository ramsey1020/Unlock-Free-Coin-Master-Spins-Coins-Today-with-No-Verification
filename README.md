Spin the slot machine: Play the mini-game to earn rewards, including free coins and extra spins.
Bet more on the slot machine: This is a risk versus reward situation. If you have many spins saved up, you can increase your betting stake on the slot machine. Youâ€™ll end up sitting more spins but also increase the potential payout. The more you bet, the higher the payout will be. Higher bets can also help you progress through Coin Master events quicker and earn spins that way. Speaking of whichâ€¦

Watch out for hourly rewards: Besides daily rewards, every hour, youâ€™ll get five spins for free. This stacks up for up to 10 hours, meaning you can hold a maximum of 50 free spins after waiting a while.

Coin Master tips & tricks
Donâ€™t hoard your coins!
You are always susceptible to a potential raid taking out a large portion of your coins. This is why you should always spend coins whenever you can afford a purchase. This is especially important if youâ€™re out of Shields or havenâ€™t unlocked the Rhino Pet yet!
Having a large store of coins in your pocket makes you a prime target for Big Raids. A Big Raid is a maximum bet Raid that, if successful, can end with the Raider walking away with millions of your Coins!
Big Raids
If youâ€™ve got a ton of Coin Master free spins at your disposal, it can be tempting to raise your Bet amount and enjoy the multiplied spin onsite. This is a perfectly viable way of accelerating your Coin earnings. However, saving your spins for Raiding wealthy players is best.
Above the Slots Machine, you can see the Coin Master youâ€™ve been assigned, and their current Coin stores. Save your Bets for Coin Masters with tons of coins. Since the amount of Coin you earn from a Raid is proportional to the amount of Coin the player has on them, by selling only Maximum Bets on wealthy Coin Masters, you can earn a lot of money in a very short time.
If youâ€™re going for Big Raids, you should always have Foxy equipped as your active Pet. Foxy gives you another shovel to dig with on Raids, so you have an added chance of getting tons of coins.
Buy chests in every village.
Individual cards donâ€™t offer any bonsitees, but completing a Card Collection does. You should always purchase as many Chests as you can afford when entering a new Village. Lower level Cards become more challenging to obtain as you go up inÂ Village levels, so the early stages are the best places to get the low-level Cards you need to complete a Collection. Thereâ€™s no worse feeling than spending a Joker to replace the missing standard Card that you could have gotten way back when you first started playing!
Donâ€™t waste your petâ€™s onsite
Your Pet's boosting effect is only available for four hours after youâ€™ve activated it. If you canâ€™t play for four hours, you should save activating your Pet until you have a four-hour window to dedicate to Coin Master.
This even applies to the defensive Rhino; when your base is under siege, he wonâ€™t defend attacks unless you specifically send him out to do so.

Coin Master tips
Jsitet started Coin Master and struggling to get the hang of it. Here are a few tips to get you on your way to becoming a Coin Master:
Donâ€™t hoard your coins: You might think scrimping and saving is right, but holding onto tonnes of coins can do you more harm than good. Sitting on a massive stack of coins means youâ€™re at risk of attacks from other players, who can quickly deplete your funds. Itâ€™s best to spend as you go along.
site pets well: With all the village building and slot machine spinning, itâ€™s easy to forget about pets. But once youâ€™ve unlocked pets, itâ€™s well worth seeing them each day you play Coin Master. Every 24 hours, youâ€™ll get one treat you can feed your pet and the other snacks you can get. Looking after your pet and feeding them treats will help you boost the amount of rewards you can get from raids and help you progress through villages quicker.
Buy chests: When you drop into a new village, buying as many chests as possible is a good idea. Opening chests will let you claim a selection of cards, and while individual cards wonâ€™t help you progress through Coin Master, completing card collections will let you get useful rewards like extra spins and new pets.
Save your bets: You can multiply the rewards you can claim on the Coin Master slot machine by increasing your bet. This site up more spins than steal, but will also dish out increased rewards. Since spins can be hard to come by, itâ€™s best to site your bets when you can raid a player who's hoarding a massive amount of coins. Keep an eye out for the Super Bet event, which lets you bet even more spins than usual and significantly increases your potential payout.
